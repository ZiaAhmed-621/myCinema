                <p class="p">A name you might only recognize if you are a true film historian. Fritz Lang directed one
                    of the most iconic sci-fi films of all time in 1927, Metropolis. What is even more impressive is
                    that he did it all in the silent film era. Lang helped revolutionize special effects, using the
                    Schüfftan process, a system that uses mirrors to create special illusions on set. This process is
                    still used today. Some of the best directors, like George Lucas, Christopher Nolan, and Stanley
                    Kubrick, have cited Lang as an influential figure in their work.</p>

                    and is credited with being one of the first to combine live-action and animation in his film. He has
                    also been credited for bringing transmedia storytelling into filmmaking, a concept that George Lucas
                    would go on to perfect.</p>

A student of other directors, he helped create the famous horror movie franchise Halloween on a budget of only $325,000. He added suspense by creating holes in the film, where the audience supplies the means to create a scary scene. Very few directors have been able to re-create these frightening effects. He went on to other projects but will forever be known as the director who brought slasher films to the mainstream..</p>

Kubrick was one of the first filmmakers to use front projection and retroreflective matting, techniques that green screens would eventually replace. Most of Kubrick's films are considered masterpieces, including The Shining (1980) and Full Metal Jacket (1987).</p>

He went on to re-invigorate the Batman franchise, which was also a huge success, and set new standards for superhero movies. He is known for his limited use of CGI and opts for practical effects instead. His stunning landscapes and action sequences in films like Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception have changed how audiences view a film. In his latest movie, Oppenheimer, Nolan was able to re-create an atomic bond explosion with minimal CGI, an awe-inspiring feat.

When working on Jaws, he was dealing with a mechanical shark that was always breaking down. Instead of quitting, he had the genius idea to provide suspense and fear by making it all up to the audience,s mind. Eeiry music and heavy build-up struck fear in the viewers. The shark was barely shown. Since then, he has gone on to direct some of the biggest hits of all time, like E.T. and Jurrasic Park.</p>
