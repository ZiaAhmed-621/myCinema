                <p class="p">Carl Theodor Dreyer's La Passion De Jeanne D'Arc is universally regarded as a cinematic milestone. Starring Renée Jeanne Falconetti as the titular saint, this movie received widespread acclaim from critics and film scholars alike.

                    The religious ideas in La Passion De Jeanne D'Arc were subject to early controversy and infuriated several French Catholics, including the Archbishop of Paris. That said, The New York Times praised this movie to the skies, claiming that "it makes worthy pictures of the past look like tinsel shams." La Passion De Jeanne D'Arc is unquestionably among the most impressive productions in film history.</p>

                <p class="p">Ingmar Bergman delves into psychological horror territory with Persona, which follows the increasingly unnerving relationship between a nurse and her patient. Critics have observed a range of underlying themes in the film, from Jungian theory and queerness to maternity and vampirism.Persona is well-known for its experimental style, radical aesthetic, supersonic visuals, and subliminal imagery. Variety applauded "the perfection in direction, acting, editing, and lensing," the four most essential filmmaking factors. Persona involves so many intersecting metaphors and concepts that it basically defies interpretation.</p>

                <p class="p">Directed by Alan Crosland, The Jazz Singer pioneered the use of synchronized audio in Hollywood, spelling the end of the Silent Era. Movie-goers would never again have to deal with jarring, disjointed inter-title cards interrupting their cinematic experience. The Jazz Singer employed the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, a revolutionary development for the 1920s.

                    Actor/singer Al Jolson's first line, "Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothin' yet!" has become a pop-cultural touchstone. The film went on to win an Honorary Oscar at the 1st Academy Awards in 1928. Unfortunately, The Jazz Singer is also remembered for its "racial comedy," which was popular at the time but contemporary critics and fans alike now recognize it as racist.

                <p class="p">Nobody expected Night of the Living Dead to inspire a whole new genre of movies, but that's exactly what this low-budget George A. Romero classic wound up doing. The film has since diversified into a complex franchise, incorporating multiple sequels, remakes, and imitations.

                    The BBC declared Night of the Living Dead a "new dawn in horror film-making," particularly for its ingenious use of the zombie concept. Night of the Living Dead isn't just another horror movie. While Romero always said it wasn't political, the story doubles as a criticism of post-war America and the global political landscape of the era..</p>

This movie was widely considered a turning point for Indian Parallel cinema, a tradition that focused heavily on socialist ideals rather than flimsy popcorn-worthy notions.</p>

                <p class="p">Despite the image created for her by Hollywood and pop culture, Marilyn Monroe proved that she could be just as funny as any comedian in Some Like It Hot. Although the movie has a fixed narrative, the story takes viewers on a quasi-hallucinatory trip that feels too delightfully campy to be real.

                    Then again, authenticity isn't really the point of a film like Some Like It Hot. With six Oscar nominations under its belt, Some Like It Hot garnered near-universal fame from the moment it was released. Critics today deem it among the greatest movies ever made, and certainly one of the best comedies since Charlie Chaplin openly mocked Adolf Hitler in The Great Dictator.

                    The Rotten Tomatoes critics' consensus states that The Searchers "introduces dark ambivalence to the genre that remains fashionable today," highlighting the movie's overwhelming impression on the global film industry. The United States Library of Congress has preserved The Searchers in the National Film Registry, citing the movie's cultural relevance.

                <p class="p">Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura takes a patently unorthodox approach to cinema, earning mixed reviews from contemporary reviewers. In the director's obituary, The Independent later described how his movie "systematically subverted the filmic codes, practices, and structures in currency at its time," an opinion shared by the vast majority of modern critics.

                    Plot takes a backseat in L'Avventura — character emotions are instead portrayed through mood, tone, and visual texture. Despite its languorous pace, L'Avventura inevitably shatters the syntactic rules of filmmaking before remaking them in its own image. Cinema today owes a lot to this black-and-white masterpiece.

                    Critic Roger Ebert initially panned the movie, calling it "an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship," but later amended his negative appraisal by highlighting the monumental scope of Alien's imagination. This Ridley Scott movie will forever be a cinematic benchmark, no matter how many sequels, prequels, and reboots are made. Alien changed the world in ways that are still evident to this day.</p>

The cinematography has been likened to Neoclassical sculpture, albeit with a pungent postmodern twist, while the acting has distinctly Shakespearean overtones. Countless movies, TV shows, operas, and even heavy metal albums have paid tribute to The Seventh Seal.</p>

                    The Birth of a Nation is one of the most controversial movies ever made, particularly for its positive depiction of the Ku Klux Klan. The movie's release triggered riots in Philadelphia, Boston, and several other American cities. According to critic Roger Ebert, The Birth of a Nation "presents a challenge for modern audiences" because "it is a great film that argues for evil." Despite its groundbreaking innovations, this movie will always be deeply problematic. The Birth of a Nation changed the world by making things worse.</p>

                    Borat didn't just change cinema, it altered the very meaning of satire. This mockumentary was heavily censored in numerous countries, lawsuits were filed against its creators, and the Kazakh government responded by inaugurating an expensive tourism campaign. The dust has long since settled, but Borat is still here and shined an important light on how the world treated 'foreigners" in post-9/11 America.</p>

                <p class="p">Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru may not be as famous as Seven Samurai (1954) or Yojimbo (1961), but this tenderly crafted character study is just as profound and poignant as his action-oriented movies. Ikiru provides an intricate blend of humanist philosophy, familial intimacy, and musings about the inevitability of death.

                    Critic Bosley Crowther praised Kurosawa's emblematic "style of sharp reportage and introspection," affirming Ikiru's bleakly incisive take on aging. Meanwhile, Roger Ebert compared the movie to Dylan Thomas' iconic poem, "Do not go gentle into that good night," which is frequently interpreted as a rebellion against mortality. Ikiru is an emotional tour de force, and it changed the way many filmmakers think about movie</p>

                <p class="p">Robert Bresson's Au Hasard Balthazar is an agonizing tale of grief and loss, as seen through the eyes of the eponymous donkey. Although Balthazar obtains a few moments of joy over the course of his short life, they're far too sporadic to counterbalance all the abuse he suffers.

                    Critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Au Hasard Balzathar "stands by itself as one of the loftiest pinnacles of artistically realized emotional experience." This movie includes a host of overlapping analogies and allegories, making it a film academic's dream. That said, Au Hasard Balthazar works because its message is heartbreakingly clear.</p>

                <p class="p">Leni Riefenstahl's intimate relationship with the Nazi Reich is well known. She spent significant time in close quarters with Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking party members, whose repellant philosophies may have influenced her filmmaking process.

                    Riefenstahl's Olympia was supposed to be an impartial documentary about the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but the movie turned out to be an obscene piece of political propaganda from start to finish. At the same time, Olympia is nothing less than a cinematic trailblazer on multiple levels. In an article for The Guardian, Nicholas Barber explained how this movie "revolutionised the way sport was depicted on screen."</p>
